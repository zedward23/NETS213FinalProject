My post sounded more negative than it should have. I'm quite lucky to have a well paying job, a wife with a well paying job, etc. There are things that could be better, but I'm in a better position than the vast majority of people. I exercise, etc.

My negative thoughts are mainly regarding just trying to make sure I feel like I'm using my advantages to the fullest extent and that I'm just not floating through life.

This is an interesting letter though
